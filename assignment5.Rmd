# 4.7.1 summarize

the *summarize* function in dplyr provides a way to compute summary statistics with intuitive and readable code. we start with a simple example based on heights. the *heights* dataset includes heights and sex reported by students in an in-class survey.

```
library(dplyr)
library(dslabs)
data(heights)
```
the following code computed the average and standard deviation for females:

```{r}
s<- heights %>% filter(sex=="Female") %>% summarize(average= mean(height), standard_deviation = sd(height))
s
```
this takes our original data table as input, filters it to keep only females, and then produces a new summarized table with just the average and the standard deviation of heights. we get to choose the names of the columns of the resulting table. for example, above we decided to use *average* and *standard_deviation*. but we could have used other names just the same.
because the resulting table stored in *s* is a data frame, we can access the components with the accessor *$*:
```{r}
s$average
s$standard_deviation
```

as with most other dplyr functions, summarize is aware of the variale names and we can use them directly. so when inside the call to the summarize function we write *mean(height)*, the function is accessing the column with the name "height" and then computing the average of the resulting numeric vector. we can compute any other summary that operates on vectors and returnsa single value. for example, we can add the median, minimum, and maximum heights like this:
```{r}
heights %>% filter(sex== "Female") %>% summarise(median = median(height), minimum = min(height), maximum= max(height))

```
we can obtain these three values with just one line using the *quantile* function: for example, *quantile(x, c(0,0.5,1))* returns the min(0%), median(50%), max(100%) of the vector *x*. however, if we attempt to use a function like this that returns two or more values inside *summarize*:
```{r}
heights %>% filter(sex== "Female") %>% summarize(range= quantile(height, c(0, 0.5, 1)))
```
we will recieve an error: *Error: expecting result of length one, got:2*. with the function *summerize*, we can only call funcions that return a single value. in section 4.12, we will learn how to deal with functions that return more than one value.

for another example of how we can use the summarize function, let's compute the average murder rate for united states. remember our data table includes total murders and population size for each state and we have already used dplyr to add a murder rate colnumn:
```{r}
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
murders<- mutate(murders, rate= total/population*10^5)
murders %>% summarise(average= mean(rate))
```
remember that the US murder rate is not the average of the state murder rates.
this is because in the computation above the small states are given the same weight as the large ones. the US murder rate is the total number of murders in the US divided by the total US population. so the correct computation is:
```{r}
us_murder_rate<- murders %>% summarise(rate= sum(total)/sum(population)*10^5)
us_murder_rate
```
this computation counts larger states proportionally to their size which results in a larger value.

# 4.7.2 pull
the *us_murder_rate* object defined above represents just one number. yet we are storing it in a data frame:
```{r}
class(us_murder_rate)
```
since, as most dplyr functions, summarize always returns a data frame.
this might be problematic if we want to use this result with funcitons that reuqire a numeric value. here we show a useful trick for accessing values stored in data when using pipes: when a data object is piped that object and its columns can be accessed using the *pull* function. to understand what we mean take a look at this line of code:
```{r}
us_murder_rate %>% pull(rate)
```
this reuturns the value in the rate column of us_murdrer_rate making it equivalent to us_murders_rate$rate.
to get a number from the original data table with one line of code we can type:
```{r}
us_murder_rate<- murders %>%  summarise(rate = sum(total)/sum(population)*10^5) %>% pull(rate)
us_murder_rate
```
which is now a numeric:
```{r}
class(us_murder_rate)
```
# 4.7.3 group then summarize with *group_by*

a common operation in data exploration is to first split data into groups and then compute summaries for each group. for example, we may want to compute the average and standard deviation for men's and women's heights separately. the *group_by* function helps us do this.
if we type this:
```{r}
heights %>% group_by(sex)
```
the result does not look very different from *heights*, except we see *groups:sex[2]* when we print the object. although not immediately obvious from its appearance, this is now a special data frame called a grouped data frame, and dplyr functions, in particular *summarize*, will behave differently when acting on this object. conceptually, you can think of this table as many tables, with the same columns but not necessarily the same number of rows, stacked together in one object. when we summarize the data after grouping, this is what happens:
```{r}
heights %>% group_by(sex) %>% summarize(average= mean(height), standard_deviation= sd(height))
```
the summarize function applies the summarization to each group separately.
for another eample, let's compute the median murder rate in the for regions of the country:
```{r}
murders %>% group_by(region) %>% summarise(median_rate= median(rate))
```
# 4.8 sorting data frames
when examining a dataset, it is often convenient to sort the table by the different columns. we know about the *order* and *sort* function, but for ordering entire tables, the dplyr function *arrange* is useful. for example, here we order the states by population size:
```{r}
murders %>% arrange(population) %>% head()
```
with arrange we get to decide which column to sort by. to see the states by murder rate, from lowest to highest, we arrange by rate instead:
```{r}
murders %>% arrange(rate) %>% head()
```
note that the default behavior is to order in ascending order. in dplyr, the function *desc* transforms a vector so that it is in descending order. to sort the table in descending order, we can type:
```{r}
murders %>% arrange(desc(rate))
```

# 4.8.1 nested sorting
if we are ordering by a column with ties, we can use a second column to bread the tie. similarly, a third column can be used to break ties between first and second and so on. here we order by region, then within region we order by murder rate:
```{r}
murders %>% arrange(region, rate) %>% head()
```
# 4.8.2 the top n
in the code above, we have used the fucntion *head* to avoid haing the page fill up with the entire dataset, if we want to see a larger proportion, we can use the *top_n* function. this function takes a data frame as it's first argument, the number of rows to show in the second, and the variable to filter by in the third. here is an example of how to see the top 5 rows:
```{r}
murders %>% top_n(5, rate)
```
note that rows are not sorted by *rate*, only filtered. if we want to sort, we need to use *arrange*. note that if the third argument is left blank, *top_n* filters by the last column.

# 4.9 exercises

```
install.packages("NHANES")

library(NHANES)
data(NHANES)
```
View(NHANES)

1. We will provide some basic facts about blood pressure. first let's select a group to set the standard. we will use 20 to 29 year-old females. *AgeDecade* is a categorical variable with these ages. note that the category is coded like "20-29", with a space in front! what is the average and standard deviation of systolic blood pressure as saved in the *BPSysAve* variable? save it to a vairable called *ref*.
```{r}
ref<- NHANES %>% filter(Gender == "female", AgeDecade == " 20-29") %>% summarise(average= mean(BPSysAve, na.rm = TRUE), standard_deviation= sd(BPSysAve, na.rm = TRUE))
ref
```
2. using a pipe, assign the average to a numeric variable *ref_avg*.
```{r}
ref %>% pull(average)
```
3. now report the min and max values for the same group.
```{r}
NHANES %>% filter(Gender == "female", AgeDecade == " 20-29") %>% summarise(minimun=min(BPSysAve, na.rm = TRUE), maximum=max(BPSysAve, na.rm = T))
```
4. compute the average and standard deviation for females, but for each age group separately rather than a selected decade as in question 1. note that the age groups are defined by *AgeDecade*.
```{r}
NHANES %>% filter(Gender== "female") %>% group_by(AgeDecade) %>% summarise(average= mean(BPSysAve, na.rm = TRUE), standard_deviation= sd(BPSysAve, na.rm = TRUE))
```
5. repeat exercise 4 for males.
```{r}
NHANES %>% filter(Gender=="male") %>% group_by(AgeDecade) %>% summarize(average= mean(BPSysAve, na.rm = TRUE), standard_deviation= sd(BPSysAve, na.rm = TRUE))
```
6. we can actually combine both summaries for exercise 4 and 5 into one lines of code. this is because *group_by* permits us to group by more than one variable. obtain one big summary table using *group_by(AgeDecade, Gender)*.
```{r}
NHANES %>% group_by(AgeDecade, Gender) %>%summarise(average= mean(BPSysAve, na.rm = TRUE), standard_deviation= sd(BPSysAve, na.rm = TRUE))
```
7. for males between the ages of 40-49, compare systolic blood pressure across race as reported in the *Race1* variable. order the resulting table from lowest to highest average systolic blood pressure.
```{r}
NHANES %>%filter(Gender== 'male', AgeDecade== " 40-49") %>% group_by(Race1) %>% summarise(average= mean(BPSysAve, na.rm = T))
```

# 4.10 Tibbles
where is the group information stored in the data frame?
```{r}
murders %>% group_by(region)
```
notice that there are no columns with this information. but, if you look closely at the output above, you see the line *a tibble* followed by dimensions. we can learn the class of the returned object using:
```{r}
murders %>% group_by(region) %>% class()
```

the *tbl* pronounced tibble, is a special kind of data frame. the functions *group_by* and *summarize* always return this type of data frame. the group_by function returns a special kind of *tbl* , the *grouped_df*. we will say more about these later. for consistency, the dplyr manipuation verbs(select, filter, mutate and arrange) preserve the class of the input: if they receive a regular data frame they return a regular data frame, while if they receive a tibble they return a tibble. but tibbles are the preferred format in the tidyverse and as a result tidyverse functions that produce a data frame from scratch return a tibble. for example, in chapter 5 we will see that tidyverse functions used to import data create tibbles. tibbles are very similar to data frames. in fact, you can think of them as a modern version of data frames. nontheless there are three important differences which we describe next.

# 4.10.1 tibbles display better
```{r}
murders
as_tibble(murders)
```

# 4.10.2 subsets of tibble sare tibbles
if you subset the columns of a data frame, you may get back an object that is not a data frame, such as a vector or scalar. for example:
```{r}
class(murders[,4])
```
is not a data frame. with tibbles this does not happen:
```{r}
class(as_tibble(murders[,4]))
```
this is useful in the tidyverse since functions require data frames as input.
with tibbles, if you want to access the vector that defines a column, and not get back a data frame, you need to use the accessor *$*:
```{r}
class(as_tibble(murders)$population)
```
a related feature is that tibbles will give you a warning if you try to access a column that does not exist. if we accidentally write *Population* instead of *population* this:
```{r}
murders$Population
```
returns a *NULL* with no warning, which can mae it harder to debug. in contrast, if we try this with a tibble we get an informative warning:
```{r}
as_tibble(murders)$Population
```

# 4.10.3 tibbles can have complex entries
while data frame columns need to be vectors of numbers, strings, or logical values, tibbles can have more complex objects, such as lists or functions. also, we can create tibbles with functions:
```{r}
tibble(id= c(1,2,3), func=c(mean, median, sd))
```
# 4.10.4 tibbles can be grouped
# 4.10.5 create a tibble using *tibble* instead of *data.frame*
it is sometimes useful for us to create our own data frmaes. to create a data frmae in the tibble format, you can do this by using the *tibble* function.
```{r}
grades<- tibble(names= c("John", "Juan", "Jean", "Yao"), exam_1=c(95,80,90,85), exam_2=c(90,85,85,90))
class(grades$names)
```
to avoid this, we use the rather cumbersome argument *stingsAsFactors*:
```{r}
grades<- tibble(names= c("John", "Juan", "Jean", "Yao"), exam_1=c(95,80,90,85), exam_2=c(90,85,85,90), stringsAsFactors= F)
class(grades$names)
```
to convert a regular data frame to a tibble, you can use the *as_tibble*function.
```{r}
as_tibble(grades) %>% class()
```

# 4.11 the dot operator
one of the advantages of using the pipe *%>%* is that we do not have to keep naming new objects as we manipulate the data frame. As a quick reminder, if we want to compute the median rate for states in the southern states, instead of typing:
```{r}
tab_1<- filter(murders, region == "South")
tab_2<- mutate(tab_1, rate=total/population*10^5)
rates<- tab_2$rate
median(rates)
```
we can avoid defining any new intermediate objects by instead typing:
```{r}
murders %>% filter(region== "South") %>% mutate(rate= total/population*10^5) %>% summarize(median=median(rate)) %>% pull(median)
```
we can do this because each of these functions takes a data frames as the first argument. but what if we want to access a component of the data frame. for example, what if the *pull* function was not available and we wanted to access *tab_2$rate*? what data frame name would we use? the answer is the dot operator.
for example to access the rate vector without the *pull* function we could use
```{r}
rates<- filter(murders, region=="South") %>% mutate(rate=total/population*10^5) %>% .$rate
median(rates)
```
in the next section, we will see other instances in which using the *.* is useful.

# 4.12 do
the *do* function serves as a bridge between R functions such as *quantile* and the tidyverse. the *do* function understands grouped tibbles and always returns a data frame.

```{r}
data(heights)
heights %>%filter(sex=="Female") %>% summarize(range=quantile(height, c(0,0.5,1)))
```
first we have to write a function that fits into the tidyverse approach: that is, it receives a data frame and returns a data frame.
```{r}
my_summary<-function(dat){
  x<- quantile(dat$height, c(0,0.5,1))
  tibble(min=x[1], median=x[2], max=x[3])
}
```

we can now apply the function to the heights dataset to obtain the summaries:
```{r}
heights %>% group_by(sex) %>% my_summary
```
but this is not what we want. we want a summary for each sex and the code returned just one summary. this is because *my_summary* is not part of the tidyverse and does not know how to handled grouped tibbles. *do* makes this connection:
```{r}
heights %>% group_by(sex) %>% do(my_summary(.))
```
note that here we need to use the dot operator. the tibble created by group_by is piped to do. within the call to do, the name of this tibble is . and we want to send it to my_summary. if you do not use the dot, then my_summary has no argument and returns an error telling us that argument"dat" is missing. you can see the error by typing:
```{r}
heights %>% group_by(sex) %>% do(my_summary())
```
if you do not use the parenthesis, then the function is not executed and instead do tries to return the function. this gives an error because do must always return data frame. you can see the error by typing:
```{r}
heights %>% group_by(sex) %>% do(my_summary)
```
# 4.13 the purrr package
in section3.5 we learned about the *sapply* function, which permitted us to apply the same function to each element of a vector. we constructed a function and used *sapply* to compute the sum of the first *n* integers for several values of *n* like this:
```{r}
compute_s_n<- function(n){
  x<- 1:n
  sum(x)
}
n<- 1:25
s_n<-sapply(n, compute_s_n)
```
this type of operation, applying the same function or procedure to elements of an object, is quite common in data analysis. the purrr package includes functions similar to *sapply* but that better interact with other tidyverse functions. the main advantage is that we can better control the output type of functions. in contrast, sapply can return several different object types; for example, we might expect a numeric result from a line of code, but sapply might convert our result to character under some sircumestances, purrr functions will never do this: they will return objects of a specified type or type of return an error if this is not possible.
the first purrr function we will learn is *map* , which works very similar to *sapply*. but always, without exception, returns a list:
```{r}
library(purrr)
s_n<- map(n, compute_s_n)
class(s_n)
```
if we want a numeric vector, we can instead use *map_dbl* which always returns a vector numeric values.
```{r}
s_n<- map_dbl(n, compute_s_n)
class(s_n)
```
this produces the same results as the sapply call shown above.
a particularly useful purrr function for interacting with the rest of the tidyverse is *map_df*, which always returns a tibble data frame. however, the function being called needs to return a vector or a list with names. for this reson, the following code would result in a *Argument 1 must have names* error:
```{r}
s_n<- map_df(n, compute_s_n)
```
we need to change the function to make this work:
```{r}
compute_s_n<- function(n){
  x<-1:n
  tibble(sum=sum(x))
}
s_n<- map_df(n, compute_s_n)
```
the purrr package provides much more functionality not covered here.

# 4.14 tidyverse conditionals
# 4.14.1 case_when
the case_when function is useful for vectorizing conditional statements. it is similar to ifelse but can output any numberof values, as opposed to just TRUE or FALSE. here is an example splitting numbers into negative, positive, and 0:
```{r}
x<- c(-2,-1,0,1,2)
case_when(x<0 ~"Negative",
          x>0 ~"Positive",
          TRUE ~"Zero")
```

a common use for this function is to define categorical variables based on existing variables. for example, suppose we want to compare the murder rates in four groups of states. for each state, we need to ask if it is in New England, if it is not we ask if it is in the West Caoast, if not we ask if it is in the south, and if not we assign other. here is how we use case_when to do this:
```{r}
murders %>% mutate(group= case_when(
  abb%in% c("ME","NH","VY","MA","RI","CT")~ "New England",
  abb%in% c("WA","OR","CA")~ "Weat Coast",
  region == "South" ~ "South",
  TRUE ~ "Other"
)) %>% group_by(group) %>% summarise(rate=sum(total)/sum(population)*10^5)
```
# 4.14.2 between
a common operation in data analysis is to determine if a value falls inside an interval. we can check this using conditionals. for example, to check if the elements of a vector *x* are between a and b we can type
```
x>=a & x<=b
```
however, this can become cumbersome, especially within the tidyverse approach. the between function performs the same operation.
```
between(x,a,b)
```

# 4.15 exercises
1. load the murders dataset. which of the following is true?

head(murders)
```
answer: b
```

2. use as_tibble to convert the murders data table into a tibble and save it in an object called murders_tibble.
```{r}
murders_tibble<- as_tibble(murders)
```
3. use the group_by function to convert murders into a tibble that is grouped by region.
```{r}
murders %>% group_by(region)
```
4. write tidyverse code that is equivalent to this code:
```
exp(mean(log(murders$population)))
```
```{r}
murders %>% pull(population) %>% log() %>% mean() %>% exp()
```
5. use the map_df to create a data frame three columns named n, s_n, and s_n_2. the first column should contain the numbers 1 through 100. the second and third columns should each contain the sum of 1 through n with n the row number.
```{r}
s_n<- function(n){
  x<- 1:n
  tibble(sum=sum(x))
}
s_n_2<- function(n){
  x<- 1:n
  tibble(sum_2=sum(x))
}
n<- 1:100
```
